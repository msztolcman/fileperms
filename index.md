fileperms
==========

`fileperms` is small library for describing file permissions.

Current stable version
----------------------

1.0.2

Features
--------

* easy manipulating of permissions
* works fine with `os.chmod` and `pathlib.Path`

Python version
--------------

`fileperms` works only with Python 3.3+. Older Python versions are unsupported.

For Python 3.3 [enum34](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/enum34) library must be installed.

Some examples
-------------

    >>> import fileperms
    >>> fileperms.Permissions.from_path('/etc')
    <Permissions(0755)>
      
    >>> import os, stat
    >>> print(stat.filemode(os.stat(path).st_mode))
    -rw-------
    >>> prm = fileperms.Permissions.from_path(path)
    >>> prm
    <Permissions(0600)>
    >>> prm.to_filemode()
    'rw-------'
    >>> prm.owner_exec = True
    >>> prm.other_exec = True
    >>> os.chmod(path, prm)
    >>> print(stat.filemode(os.stat(path).st_mode))
    -rwx-----x
    
    >>> import pathlib
    >>> path = pathlib.Path(path)
    >>> prm.group_read = True
    >>> prm.group_write = True
    >>> path.chmod(prm)
    >>> print(stat.filemode(path.stat().st_mode))
    -rwxrw---x

Installation
------------

1. Using PIP

`fileperms` should work on any platform where [Python](http://python.org)
is available, it means Linux, Windows, MacOS X etc, but is not tested on Windows. 

Simplest way is to use Python's built-in package system:

    pip3 install fileperms

2. Using sources

Download sources from [Github](https://github.com/msztolcman/fileperms/archive/1.0.2.zip):

    wget -O 1.0.2.zip https://github.com/msztolcman/fileperms/archive/1.0.2.zip
    
or

    curl -o 1.0.2.zip https://github.com/msztolcman/fileperms/archive/1.0.2.zip

Unpack:

    unzip 1.0.2.zip

And install

    cd fileperms-1.0.2
    python3 setup.py install

Voila!
