fileperms
==========

`fileperms` is small library for describing file permissions.

Current stable version
----------------------

1.0.4

Features
--------

* easy manipulating of permissions
* works fine with `os.chmod` and `pathlib.Path`

Python version
--------------

`fileperms` works only with Python 3.3+. Older Python versions are unsupported.

For Python 3.3 [enum34](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/enum34) library must be installed.

Some examples
-------------

    # Some helper
    >>> def show_permissions(path):
    >>>     print(stat.filemode(os.stat(path).st_mode))
    >>>

    # Create Permissions object from existing file:
    >>> import fileperms
    >>> fileperms.Permissions.from_path('/etc')
    <Permissions(0755)>

    # We are working on object with permissions 0600 / rw-------
    >>> import os, stat
    >>> show_permissions(path)
    -rw-------

    # Verify that
    >>> prm = fileperms.Permissions.from_path(path)
    >>> prm
    <Permissions(0600)>
    >>> prm.to_filemode()
    'rw-------'

    # Change them a little using os.chmod
    >>> prm.owner_exec = True
    >>> prm.other_exec = True
    >>> os.chmod(path, prm)
    >>> show_permissions(path)
    -rwx-----x

    # Change them more, using pathlib module this time
    >>> import pathlib
    >>> path = pathlib.Path(path)
    >>> prm.group_read = True
    >>> prm.group_write = True
    >>> path.chmod(prm)
    >>> show_permissions(path)
    -rwxrw---x

Installation
------------

1. Using PIP

`fileperms` should work on any platform where [Python](http://python.org)
is available, it means Linux, Windows, MacOS X etc, but is not tested on Windows.

Simplest way is to use Python's built-in package system:

    pip3 install fileperms

2. Using sources

Download sources from [Github](https://github.com/msztolcman/fileperms/archive/1.0.4.zip):

    wget -O 1.0.4.zip https://github.com/msztolcman/fileperms/archive/1.0.4.zip

or

    curl -o 1.0.4.zip https://github.com/msztolcman/fileperms/archive/1.0.4.zip

Unpack:

    unzip 1.0.4.zip

And install

    cd fileperms-1.0.4
    python3 setup.py install

Voila!
